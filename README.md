# Travlr Getaways

## Description
Travlr Getaways is a mock travel booking website. Users can register accounts as a regular user, an agent, or an admin. Regular users, known as travelers, can view available trips and bookings made for them. Agents can do all of the same but can also book trips for other users. Admin users have all of the above but can also add, edit, and delete trips from the database.
